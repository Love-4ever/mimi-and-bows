Mimi & Bows — Realistic Static Website (ZIP-ready)
=================================================

What's improved
---------------
- Realistic jewelry images from Unsplash (randomized)
- Google font (Quicksand) and a simple SVG logo
- Product detail modal for nicer product browsing
- Contact page + favicon placeholder
- Better responsive layout and prices
- Same cart stored in localStorage and Formspree checkout

How to make it "exactly like your real site"
--------------------------------------------
1. Provide your real product images (zip or upload) and I will replace the Unsplash sources with your images and correct names/prices.
2. Share your logo (SVG/PNG) and I'll swap in the real one for the header and favicon.
3. Give your Formspree form ID and I'll wire it into the checkout & contact forms.
4. If you have a custom color palette or font, share the hex codes and font name and I'll apply them.

Download
--------
The ZIP is ready. After you download and test locally, tell me which of the items above you'd like me to apply and upload the assets here — I will replace them and regenerate the ZIP immediately.
